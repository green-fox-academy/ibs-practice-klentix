# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
a = 22
b = 13
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
print ('addition:', b+a)
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
print ('substraction:', b-a)
# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13
print ('multiplication:', a*b)
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
print ('devision with decimal fraction:', a/b)
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
print ('divison with integer:', a//b)
# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13
print ('remainder:', a % b)
